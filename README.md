# Employee record managemnt system Through GUI
GUI is a Graphical Interface that is a visual representation of communication presented to the user for easy interaction with the machine. GUI means Graphical User Interface. It is the common user Interface that includes Graphical representation like buttons and icons, and communication can be performed by interacting with these icons rather than the usual text-based or command-based communication.
# Understanding 
A common example of a GUI is Microsoft operating systems.
Consider using MS-DOS and Windows 7.
Now the most important revelation is the easiness that Windows 7 brings to the table.
Windows 7 is the go-to option for a common user without a doubt because it is hard for them to communicate with the machine through commands as in MS-DOS.
Why Windows 7 is easier to use for a common user? The answer is GUI.
Yes, GUI helps the user understand the functionalities present within the computer through Graphical icons. A click on the icon initiates the action and the user’s desired communication.
Thus, GUI provides the functionality by abstracting the hard to understand each component/module’s technical details and provides hassle-free usage of the system.
